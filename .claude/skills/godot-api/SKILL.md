description: Look up an exact Godot, std, or project API — a class's methods, signatures, parameters, signals, constants, or enum values — against a generated reference instead of recalling it. Use when unsure whether a method exists, what it is named, what it returns, or what arguments it takes.

Answer API questions by grepping a generated reference, never from memory. Engine APIs shift between minor versions and `std` is a private library with no public docs, so a recalled signature is a guess that compiles only by luck.

## When to use something else

Grep the source instead when the question is "what does this do" about a single `std`, `project`, `system`, or `platform` symbol, and you already know where it lives:

```sh
grep -rn -B6 "func load_save_data" addons/std/save/
```

The `##` comment above the definition is the same prose the dump carries, and it costs no dump. The dump earns its keep in two cases the source cannot answer:

- **Engine classes**, which are not in the repository at all. This is the main case — `ResourceUID.create_id_for_path`, `RenderingServer.frame_post_draw`, `DisplayServer` capability checks.
- **Inherited members**, where the dump flattens the chain into one file per class. `StdSaveFile` inherits through `StdConfigWriterBinary`, `StdConfigWriter`, `StdFileWriter`, and `StdThreadWorker`; the source makes you walk it by hand.

## Generating the dump

The reference lives in `.godot-api/`, which is gitignored, so it is absent in a fresh clone and stale after a `std` bump or an edit to any `##` doc comment. Regenerate it whenever a lookup comes back empty or contradicts the code:

```sh
sh .claude/skills/godot-api/dump_api.sh
```

Takes about 8 seconds and prints a class count per tree. It removes each tree before rewriting it, so a renamed or deleted class never lingers.

## Layout

| Tree | Holds | Prose? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.godot-api/engine/` | ~1080 built-in classes, from ClassDB reflection | **No** |
| `.godot-api/std/` | `addons/std`, from its `##` comments | Yes |
| `.godot-api/project/` | project classes, by `class_name` | Yes |
| `.godot-api/system/`, `.godot-api/platform/` | the autoloaded subsystems | Yes |

**The engine tree carries signatures but no descriptions** — a release binary does not embed the documentation text, and `--doctool` regenerates from reflection alone. So "what are the arguments" is answerable there and "what does it do" is not. For that, use the online docs for the pinned version, or read how the project already calls it.

Engine classes are split across `doc/classes/` and `modules/*/doc_classes/`, so find the file rather than assuming a path:

```sh
find .godot-api/engine -name 'ResourceUID.xml'
```

## Looking something up

The files are XML, so grep the tag, not free text:

```sh
# every method on a class, with its file
grep -o '<method name="[^"]*"' "$(find .godot-api/engine -name 'ResourceUID.xml')"

# one method's full signature: return type, then each parameter in order
grep -A6 '<method name="create_id_for_path"' "$(find .godot-api/engine -name 'ResourceUID.xml')"

# a project or std class, which is one predictable file
grep -A8 '<method name="load_save_data"' .godot-api/std/StdSaveFile.xml

# properties, signals, constants and enum values
grep -E '<member name=|<signal name=|<constant name=' .godot-api/project/Main.xml

# "which class has this member?" — matches a method, signal, property or constant
grep -rl 'name="frame_post_draw"' .godot-api/
```

`<return type=...>` gives the return, `<param index=... name=... type=... />` gives arguments in order, and an `enum="Class.EnumName"` attribute on either means the int is an enum whose values are `<constant>` entries in that class's file.

## Verification

End every lookup by quoting the line you found, not a paraphrase of it. If a grep returns nothing, the answer is not "the method does not exist" until you have confirmed the class file itself is present — an empty result far more often means the dump is stale or the class name is spelled differently. Regenerate, then say the method does not exist.

## project/ui/hud/group.gd
##
## HudGroup is the root of a HUD group scene, the bundle of elements one entity gets.
## It is positioned by a `WorldTracker` authored alongside it, so every element inside
## is laid out with ordinary `Control` anchoring and containers rather than with
## per-element screen offsets.
##
## A game authors a group by inheriting `group_2d.tscn` or `group_3d.tscn` and attaching
## its own script, which extends this one to name its elements:
##
##     class_name EnemyHud
##     extends HudGroup
##
##     var health: HudBar = null
##
##     func _bind_elements() -> void:
##         health = $Rows/Health
##
## **Use `_bind_elements`, not `@onready`.** A group is mounted on the HUD layer, which
## lives in the UI subtree, and Godot readies that subtree *after* the game world. An
## entity placed in a map scene at author time therefore reaches its own `_ready` while
## the group's `@onready` members are still null. `_bind_elements` runs as soon as the
## group is instantiated, before it is mounted, so it is correct whichever way the
## entity arrived.
##
## The group is instantiated by `HudLayer` on behalf of a `HudAnchor`; nothing else
## should create one.

# -- CONFIGURATION ------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## tracker drives this group's screen position from the anchored entity. It is authored
## as a child in the group scene, and `HudLayer` supplies its `map` and `target`.
@export var tracker: WorldTracker = null

## hide_offscreen hides the group while the tracked entity is outside the viewport. Turn
## it off for a group meant to stay visible at the viewport edge, such as an off-screen
## indicator, which pairs with `clamped` on the tracker.
@export var hide_offscreen: bool = true:
	set(value):
		hide_offscreen = value

		# NOTE: The property is live rather than read once at `_ready`, which would
		# leave a group hidden with nothing to show it. Both directions are handled:
		# turning it off reveals a hidden group, and turning it on hides one whose
		# entity is already out of view rather than waiting for the next crossing.
		if is_node_ready():
			visible = is_target_in_view or not value

# -- INITIALIZATION ------------------------------------------------------------------ #

## anchor is the `HudAnchor` this group was created for. Assigned by `HudLayer` before
## the group enters the tree.
var anchor: HudAnchor = null

## layer is the `HudLayer` hosting this group. Assigned by `HudLayer` before the group
## enters the tree.
var layer: HudLayer = null

## is_target_in_view reports whether the tracked entity is inside the viewport. It is
## kept from the tracker's view-crossing signals, so an element such as an off-screen
## indicator can read it without tracking anything itself.
var is_target_in_view: bool = true

## was_bound_in_tree records whether this group had already been mounted when its
## elements were bound. It must be false, and there is a test that it is, since binding
## after mounting reintroduces the ordering trap `_bind_elements` exists to remove.
var was_bound_in_tree: bool = false

# -- PUBLIC METHODS ------------------------------------------------------------------ #


## of returns the `HudGroup` containing `node`, or `null` when it has none.
##
## NOTE: An ancestor walk rather than `owner`, which names the root of the scene a node
## was *saved* in. An element inside a sub-scene reused across several group scenes has
## that sub-scene's root as its owner, not the group, and the failure is silent.

## nothing else should.

	was_bound_in_tree = is_inside_tree()
	_bind_elements()


## get_world_position returns the anchored entity's position in world space, for
## elements that need to freeze a point in the world. The concrete type is `Vector2` in
## a 2D map and `Vector3` in a 3D one.
func get_world_position() -> Variant:

	return anchor.get_world_position() if anchor else null


## make_world_origin returns a callable giving the screen position of the entity's world
## position *as it is now*, re-projected on every call. An element that wants to stay
## over the spot it was spawned at holds onto this rather than a screen position, so the
## camera can pan away underneath it.
##
## The callable answers a non-finite vector when the point cannot be projected, which is
## what a 3D point behind the camera does.
func make_world_origin() -> Callable:
	var world_position: Variant = get_world_position()
	var hud := layer

	if world_position == null or not hud:
		return Callable()

	return func() -> Vector2: return hud.project_world(world_position)


## project_target returns where the anchored entity is on screen right now, unclamped.
## An element that needs to point at the entity reads this rather than its own rect,
## which the tracker may already have clamped onto the viewport edge.
func project_target() -> Vector2:
	var world_position: Variant = get_world_position()
	if world_position == null or not layer:
		return Vector2.INF
